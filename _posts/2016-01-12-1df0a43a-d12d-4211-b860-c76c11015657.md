The series entitled "Pigment" was created whilst completing my IB Art. It was inspired by Thomas David's series named "Dance and Dust". They showed me the power of 'dust' and how it can change an image.
Based on this concept I envisioned a series of portraits, however with pigment powder bringing these to life. The models were all students within the same school studying a variety of courses.
The set-up was minimal transforming the art room into a studio with black card and only using a speed light I was able to create the lighting.
