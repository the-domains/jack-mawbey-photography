I, Jack Mawbey am a 18 year old photography student at Bath Spa University. This is now my temporary home, for the next three years.
I am english, however I have grown up throughout Germany and Sweden, completing my IB at the International School of Bremen in June 2015\. Thanks to this diploma I was able to follow my dreams and study my passion.
The largest series which I have created as yet, is the series "Pigment", it was a large scale however low-budget photo series extensively using pigment powder to transform ordinary portraits. My largest series also gave me the largest success so far. The title photo of this series ended up being commissioned by Vodafone for the DIT Fashion Show in April 2015\.
