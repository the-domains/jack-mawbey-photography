The series "Paint" was yet another series created for submission under the IB. This was the follow up of the idea behind the series "Pigment". The pigment powder was very air based, however I wanted to see how the portraits were affected by liquid, fast paced, brightly coloured liquid.
The paint adds even more motion to the portraits as the flow is clearly defined, however in odd occasions, this exact motion also created a very simple and calm shot.
